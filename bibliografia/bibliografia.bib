The proposed system is developed for handicap/disabled persons as well as elderly persons and tested with able persons with several shapes and size of eyes under a variety of illumination conditions. The test results with normal persons show the proposed system does work well for selection of the desired foods and for retrieve the foods as appropriate as users' requirements. It is found that the proposed system is 21{\%} much faster than the manually controlled robotics.},

@misc{PatentChang2008,
	abstract = {A vehicle roof mounted video display is disclosed. The display is rotatable 180° about a first axis, between a stored position within a housing and a second position in which the display lies flat against the vehicle roof. The display is also rotatable at least 60°, and preferably 90°, about a second axis that intersects and is substantially perpendicular to the first axis. Each axis includes self-tensioning hinges to hold the display in any position. The display self aligns as it reaches either of the first and second positions so that the display is substantially parallel to the roof. When the display is in the storage position, the display Screen faces, and is safely enclosed by, the housing. The invention also includes a number of built-in features to provide passengers with a wide range of entertainment options.},

@inproceedings{Ali2007,
	abstract = {Presented in this design is an Assistive Robotic Arm. The Assistive Robotic Arm contains the following subunits: a base, upper arm, lower arm, wrist, and gripping device. The arm is controlled by a microcontroller. The base houses one motor and the microcontroller. Other features of this device include detachable grippers and utensils along with an external keypad from which the client controls the device. When the device is fully extended, the client's new radius of extension is twenty-five inches. The following design, contained in this report, is a senior design project from the University of Connecticut sponsored by the National Science Foundation(1). The design assists a young, fifth grade boy with quadriplegic, athetoid cerebral palsy to function more independently in his integrated classroom setting. The goal of this design is to provide a child with only gross motor skills a way to eat autonomously and also provide a grip mechanism that would resemble the human hand. The device also closely resembles the movements of the human arm by providing a full range of motion about the x, y, and z axes and throughout the three primary planes of motion.},

@article{Groothuis2013,
	abstract = {Assistive robotics is an increasingly popular research field, which has led to a large number of commercial and noncommercial systems aimed at assisting physically impaired or elderly users in the activities of daily living. In this article, we propose five criteria based on robotic arm usage scenarios and surveys with which assistive robotic arms can be classified. Different possibilities and implementations to obtain each criterion are treated, and examples of current assistive robotic arms are given. Implementations and systems are discussed and rated qualitatively, which leads to the observation that variable stiffness actuation offers great benefits for assistive robotic systems despite an increase in the overall complexity.},
